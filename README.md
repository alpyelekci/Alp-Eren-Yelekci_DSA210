 #In this project, I will analyze my personal Spotify data. I will be analyzing my listening habits by the time an my artist and genre preferences.

 
 Dataset: Spotify music listening history
 
 Goal: My plan is to see my listening habits is wheter changing by time of the day and week by week by my mood. Also, find potential new similar songs.

 Once I figure out the data, I will use charts and graphs to describe the data.
